# Issue Handling and Tagging

This is an outline on the procedures for processsing and prioritising Bugs submitted to F5 Openstack projects.
Users submitting bugs should fill out as much information asked for in the ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md file. Issues should
be review daily to handle critical bugs, but weekly to triage all others. See the TriagingBugIssues.md file for more
details.
