# Issue Handling and Tagging

This is an outline on the procedures for processsing and prioritising Bugs submitted to F5 Openstack projects.
Users submitting bugs should fill out as much information asked for in the ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md file. Issues should
be review daily to handle critical bugs, but weekly to triage all others. See the TriagingBugIssues.md file for more
details. 

### Bug Severity Levels
 * Set by User
 * Notifications are sent to a Slack Channel when an issue is created.
 
 1. **Bug Severity 1 (Critical)** : Defect is causing systems to be offline and/or nonfunctional. immediate attention is required.
 2. **Bug Severity 2 (High)** : Defect is causing major obstruction of system operations.
 3. **Bug Severity 3 (Medium)** : Defect is causing intermittent errors in system operations.
 4. **Bug Severity 4 (Low)** : Defect is causing infrequent interuptions in system operations.
 5. **Bug Severity 5 (Trival)** : Defect is not causing any interuptions to system operations, but none-the-less is a bug.
 
### Development Priority Levels
 * Set by F5 during a triage meeting. 
 
 1. **Priority Level 1 (Critical)** : A release to fix the bug is required as soon as possible.
 2. **Priority Level 2 (High)** : The solution to the bug will be delivered in the next sprint release 
 3. **Priority Level 3 (Medium)** : A bug fix will handled as soon as possible.
 4. **Priority Level 4 (Low)** : A bug fix will come, but it may be in a couple sprints
 5. **Priority Level 5 (Defer)** : A bug fix will be included with releases that deal with technical debt.
